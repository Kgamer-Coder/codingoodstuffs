what the heck?
so I decided to join git-hub because of a tutorial I'm taking on coursera on coding.
although I've known git-hub for a very long time now, I never felt I was "there" yet to be part of such prestigious community.
I hope my joining this platform will be an epic beginning to a dazzling journey.
have fun k. and don't game away your time.
